2. Run npm install (npm i) to install project dependencies.
3. Open two additional terminals within your VS Code editor.
4. In the second terminal, run npx hardhat node to start a local Ethereum blockchain node using Hardhat.
5. In the third terminal, execute npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/deploy.js to deploy smart contracts or perform setup tasks on the local blockchain.
6. Return to the first terminal and run npm run dev to start a local development server for the frontend application.
